## SUMMARY
- **Issue #3010:** [Cargo audit findings](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/issues/3010)

### GPT SUMMARY:
The text mentions that the `cargo audit` tool has identified several dependencies with security vulnerabilities. The specific dependencies mentioned are atty v0.2.14, webpki v0.22.0, webpki v0.21.4, and rustls v0.100.0. However, the author states that these vulnerabilities are not critical and can be addressed later. They mention that there are other potential vectors for denial of service in their own code and the exploit related to atty only affects Windows. The author suggests coordinating with a project to update the rust-bitcoin dependency, which will likely resolve the issue with newer versions of electrum-client.

## DETAILS
### Description:
[`cargo audit` is complaining about the following dependencies](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/actions/runs/5940802339/job/16110189706?pr=3009):

* [atty v0.2.14](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0145)
* [webpki v0.22.0](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0052)
* [webpki v0.21.4](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0052)
* [rustls v0.100.0](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0053)

### Comments:
- **elsirion:** None of these seem super critical to fix: either DoS (we have a lot of DoS potential vectors in our own code) and the `atty` exploit only works on windows. Let's still try to get rid of them, but we have the time to coordinate with e.g. the ongoing project to update the `rust-bitcoin` dependency (#2667) which will likely unblock newer `electrum-client` versions.
