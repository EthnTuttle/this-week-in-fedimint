## SUMMARY
- **PR #3013:** [chore: rename "module gen" to "module init"](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/pull/3013)

### GPT SUMMARY:
null

## DETAILS
### Description:
"Module Gen" was a shorthand for "Module Config Generator", but with time the whole thing took on more responsibilities, with config generation being only one of them.

Seems like all of them have something to do with
"module instance initialization", so "module init" seems like the best candidate.

Fix #2055
