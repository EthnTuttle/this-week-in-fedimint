## SUMMARY
- **PR #3003:** [chore: don't strip release binaries](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/pull/3003)

### GPT SUMMARY:
The text shows a comparison of the file sizes and permissions before and after a change. The file sizes for "fedimint-cli," "fedimintd," and "fedimint-dbtool" have increased in the "after" section. Additionally, the number of root users has changed for "fedimint-dbtool." The author mentions that although there is a cost involved, they believe it is necessary to have line numbers in panics/errors functioning.

## DETAILS
### Description:
Before:

```
-r-xr-xr-x 2 root root  37M Dec 31  1969 fedimint-cli
-r-xr-xr-x 2 root root  43M Dec 31  1969 fedimintd
-r-xr-xr-x 2 root root  31M Dec 31  1969 fedimint-dbtool
```

after

```
-r-xr-xr-x 2 root root  57M Dec 31  1969 fedimint-cli
-r-xr-xr-x 2 root root  67M Dec 31  1969 fedimintd
-r-xr-xr-x 3 root root  53M Dec 31  1969 fedimint-dbtool
```

There's a cost, but we should get line numbers in panics/errors working.
