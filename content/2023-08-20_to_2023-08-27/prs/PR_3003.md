## SUMMARY
- **PR #3003:** [chore: don't strip release binaries](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/pull/3003)

### GPT SUMMARY:
The text describes a change made to three files. The file sizes and line numbers have been increased, indicating that modifications were made to the code. The author suggests that although there may be a cost associated with this change, it is necessary in order to enable line numbers in panics/errors.

## DETAILS
### Description:
Before:

```
-r-xr-xr-x 2 root root  37M Dec 31  1969 fedimint-cli
-r-xr-xr-x 2 root root  43M Dec 31  1969 fedimintd
-r-xr-xr-x 2 root root  31M Dec 31  1969 fedimint-dbtool
```

after

```
-r-xr-xr-x 2 root root  57M Dec 31  1969 fedimint-cli
-r-xr-xr-x 2 root root  67M Dec 31  1969 fedimintd
-r-xr-xr-x 3 root root  53M Dec 31  1969 fedimint-dbtool
```

There's a cost, but we should get line numbers in panics/errors working.
