## SUMMARY
- **PR #3020:** [chore(ci): increase linux build timeout](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/pull/3020)

### GPT SUMMARY:
The text mentions that there have been several instances where tests are timing out while fetching from nix caches. It suggests that there could be temporary network congestion, but emphasizes that this should not be causing the tests to fail. One person expresses doubt that the issue will be resolved, while another person wonders if the problem resolved itself after a long period of time.

## DETAILS
### Description:
We are [seeing a lot of tests time out](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/actions/runs/5953944182/job/16149367352?pr=3008) while fetching from our nix caches, there might be temporary network congestion, but that shouldn't make our tests fail.

### Comments:
- **elsirion:** I doubt it will help after chatting with @dpc about it :(
- **elsirion:** Maybe I was wrong and whatever was stuck unstuck itself after an ungodly amount of time?!
