## SUMMARY
- **PR #3020:** [chore(ci): increase linux build timeout](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/pull/3020)

### GPT SUMMARY:
There have been numerous tests that are timing out while fetching from our nix caches. This could be due to temporary network congestion, but it should not cause the tests to fail. After discussing with dpc, elsirion is unsure if the issue can be resolved. However, it is possible that the problem resolved itself after a long period of time.

## DETAILS
### Description:
We are [seeing a lot of tests time out](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/actions/runs/5953944182/job/16149367352?pr=3008) while fetching from our nix caches, there might be temporary network congestion, but that shouldn't make our tests fail.

### Comments:
- **elsirion:** I doubt it will help after chatting with @dpc about it :(
- **elsirion:** Maybe I was wrong and whatever was stuck unstuck itself after an ungodly amount of time?!
