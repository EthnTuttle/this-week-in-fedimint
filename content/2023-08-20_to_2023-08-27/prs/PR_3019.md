The text discusses the inconvenience of scripts exiting but leaving certain processes running, which can lead to failures if another script starts immediately and tries to use the same resources. The response from user "douglaz" suggests that they have a better idea.

## DETAILS
### Description:
It's inconvenient when a script exits but still leaves stuff running (even if these processes have just received a signal and will hopefully die soon). This can cause failures if some other script starts right away and uses the same resources.
